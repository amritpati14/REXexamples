CSSM - Simulation of discretized continuous state space models
==============================================================

The source files illustrating the use of a discretized continous state space 
models in REXYGEN are located in this folder.

The CSSM block (Continuous State Space Model) simulates behavior of a linear system.
Parameters of the system are automatically converted to the discrete state space 
model according to execution period of the task. Thanks to this feature, user
can simulate systems in task with slow execution period.

The CDELSSM block, which is present in the task too, allow to user set the time 
delay of the system and simulate more complex group of systems.

The signals are recorded in the TRND block which allows displaying of the trends 
(graphs) in the Watch mode of *REXYGEN Studio* or in the *REXYGEN Diagnostics* diagnostic tool. 

## Timing of the project ##

The algorithm runs each 1 second (1.0 s) by default. See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.1 x 10 = 1.0 

## Prerequisites ##
- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* must be installed and running on the target device.
- License for advanced blocks library must be installed.

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file.
- Open it with *REXYGEN Studio*.
- Change simulation task sampling period by changing the tick in the EXEC block.
- Set parameters of the simulated system tu the CSSM and SCELSSM blocks.
- Compile and download example to the target device.
- Switch to online mode and watch the algorithm.
- Open trend diagnostic window for the block TRND.
- See the results in the TRND block.
