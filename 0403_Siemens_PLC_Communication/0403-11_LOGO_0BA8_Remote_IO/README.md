Using Siemens LOGO! as remote I/O for REXYGEN
============================================================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on using 
Siemens LOGO! 0BA8 as remote I/O unit, just like in the case of Modbus TCP 
I/O devices.

There is a dummy project for LOGO! which must run in the device. See the *logo_dummy.lsc* project. The 
LOGO! acts as a server.

There is also a project for REXYGEN, which illustrates the direct
access to Inputs (I, AI), Outputs (Q) and backlight from the REXYGEN control algorithm. 
REXYGEN acts as a client and connects to the LOGO! base module via Ethernet.

Analog inputs of the LOGO! are read and stored in the TRND block in the REXYGEN control algorithm, which provides a time-plot of the measured data in real-time.

## Prerequisities ##
- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* and S7Drv modules are installed on the target device
- The LOGO! device is in RUN mode (*logo_dummy.lsc* attached)
- The IP address 192.168.1.111 is assumed in the LOGO! device. If the IP address 
differs, **remember to change it** in the configuration dialog of the IO driver file according to your
LOGO! base module. As was already mentioned, LOGO! acts as a server the clients 
connect to. 

## Timing of the project ##
- The algorithm runs each 100 milliseconds (0.1 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.01 x 10 = 0.1 s
- Communication with Siemens LOGO! is performed each 50 milliseconds 
(0.05 s). See the S7C function block,
tick x factor = 0.01 x 5 = 0.05 s

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file
- Open it with *REXYGEN Studio*, compile and download it to the target device

## User interface (HMI) ##
The example is accompanied by a graphical user interface generated from *REXYGEN HMI Designer*.
