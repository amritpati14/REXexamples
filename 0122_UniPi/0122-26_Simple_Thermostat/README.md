UniPi as a simple thermostat 
============================
 
This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on using
REXYGEN on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer with the UniPi extension board. 

In this example the UniPi is configured to act as a simple thermostat. The 
temperature is measured by the 1-Wire DS18B20 sensor and the onboard relay 1 is
switched on and off with a hysteresis of 0.5Â°C.

The measured temperature and status of the relay is recorded in the TRND blocks
which allow displaying of the trends (graphs). 

## Timing of the project ##

The algorithm runs each 500 milliseconds (0.5 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.05 x 10 = 0.5 

## Prerequisites ##

- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* and *RPiDrv* modules must be installed and running on 
the Raspberry Pi.
- Owserver (part of the OWFS package) must be installed, correctly configured 
and running on the Raspberry Pi.
- I2C bus must be enabled on the Raspberry Pi.
- The wiring must comply with the attached schematics. 

## Running the example ##

- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file, open it with *REXYGEN Studio*.
- Specify the 64-bit ROM ID of the attached temperature sensor. See the 1-Wire 
driver manual below.
- Compile and download the project to the target device.
- Switch to watch mode and observe the algorithm (use Target->Watch Selection 
to display data).
