Getting started with REXYGEN  and the UniPi board
============================================

This example contains source files of a demonstration project, which is used 
in the Getting started manual for the UniPi board.

## Prerequisites ##

- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* and RPiDrv module must be installed and running on the Raspberry Pi
- I2C bus must be enabled on the Raspberry Pi
- The wiring must comply with the schematics included in the Getting started 
manual 

## Timing of the project ##
The algorithm runs each 100 milliseconds (0.1 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.05 x 2 = 0.1 s

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file. Open it with *REXYGEN Studio*.
- Compile and download the project to the target device.
- Connect to the HMI using your web browser, e.g. [http://192.168.1.100:8008](http://192.168.1.100:8008) (use the IP address of your target device!)
