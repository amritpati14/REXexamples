Monarco HAT as a simple thermostat 
==================================
 
This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on using
REXYGEN on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer with the Monarco HAT add-on board. 

In this example the Monarco HAT is configured to act as a simple thermostat. The 
temperature is measured by the 1-Wire DS18B20 sensor and the onboard digital 
output 1 (DO1) is switched on and off with a hysteresis of 0.5Â°C. The output 
signal can control e.g. an external relay.

The measured temperature and status of the output is recorded in the TRND blocks
which allow displaying of the trends (graphs). 

## Timing of the project ##

The algorithm runs each 500 milliseconds (0.5 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.05 x 10 = 0.5 

## Prerequisites ##

- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* and *MonarcoDrv* modules must be installed and running 
on the Raspberry Pi.
- Owserver (part of the OWFS package) must be installed, correctly configured 
and running on the Raspberry Pi.
- I2C bus must be enabled on the Raspberry Pi.
- The wiring must comply with the attached schematics. 

## Running the example ##

- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file, open it with RexDraw.
- Specify the 64-bit ROM ID of the attached temperature sensor. See the 1-Wire 
driver manual below.
- Compile and download the project to the target device.
- Switch to watch mode and observe the algorithm (use Target->Watch Selection 
to display real-time data).
