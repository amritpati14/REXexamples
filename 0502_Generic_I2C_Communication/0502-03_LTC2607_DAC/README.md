Using the LTC2607 DAC 
=====================

This folder contains the source files for controlling the LTC2607 2-channel
16-bit DAC via I2C bus, which is available e.g. on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer. 
The example is based on the REXLANG user-programmable function block of the REXYGEN System. 

Channel A is controlled by an integer constant (try changing it on-the-fly), 
while a sine wave is generated at channel B (frequency and signal type can be 
adjusted on-the-fly as well).  

## Timing of the project ##

The algorithm runs each 200 milliseconds (0.2 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.1 x 2 = 0.2 

## Prerequisites ##
- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* must be installed and running on the target device (Raspberry Pi).
- I2C bus must be enabled and available (e.g. /dev/i2c-1).
- The wiring must comply with the attached datasheet. 

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file.
- Open it with *REXYGEN Studio*.
- Specify the I2C bus by the p0 parameter of the REXLANG function block.
- Compile and download it to the target device.
- Switch to online mode and watch the algorithm.
- Observe voltage at DAC channel A and channel B.
- Change the CNI_channelA constant by hand as needed.
- Change the frequency and signal type in the SG signal generator as needed.
