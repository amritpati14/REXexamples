REST API example
================

The source files located in this folder illustrate how to inject data into a
running algorithm using REST API of REXYGEN Runtime Core.

The individual subfolders contain scripts and programs in various programming 
languages.  

In all scripts, there are individual HTTP POST requests for writing data of all
common types: double, long, Boolean and string.  

## Timing of the project ##
The REX algorithm runs each 100 milliseconds (0.1 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.05 x 2 = 0.1 

## Prerequisites ##
- *REXYGEN Runtime Core* must be installed and running on the target device.
- The target device is assumed to have IP address 192.168.1.100.
- User *admin* and password *mypassword* is assumed on the target device. 

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file.
- Open it with *REXYGEN Studio*.
- Compile and download it to the target device.
- Switch to *Watch mode* and observe the displayed values.
- Run any of the provided scripts. The values in REXYGEN algorithm will be 
overwritten by the values defined in the script.
